# Sister Teams Explorer

## Overview

With most of the United States under some level of lockdown and the Major League Baseball (MLB) season completely stalled out due to the COVID-19 pandemic and owner/player disputes, many American baseball fans are turning to Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) games in South Korea for some much needed entertainment. KBO games have been airing live on ESPN since late April, and will continue to air for at least the rest of the 2020 season. While many American fans are content to pick a team to support at near random or just casually follow the league as a whole, this project was designed for people who are still looking for a team to support but don't know how to choose. The code here is for an RShiny app, hosted [here](isaacrand.shinyapps.io/Sister-Teams-Explorer/) which would allow users to pick a KBO team to support based on similarity to an MLB team which they already cheer for.
